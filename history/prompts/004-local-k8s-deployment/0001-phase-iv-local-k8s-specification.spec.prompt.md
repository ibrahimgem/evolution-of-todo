## Prompt

phase IV local kubernetes deployment

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive Phase IV specification for Local Kubernetes Deployment covering:
- 5 User Stories: Containerization, Minikube Deployment, Helm Charts, AI DevOps Tools (kubectl-ai, Kagent), Docker AI (Gordon)
- 70+ Functional Requirements across all categories: Containerization, Kubernetes Manifests, Helm Charts, Minikube Deployment, AI DevOps Tool Integration, Configuration Management, Observability & Logging
- 6 Key Entities defined: Frontend/Backend Container Images, Kubernetes Deployment/Service, Helm Chart, ConfigMap, Secret, Ingress
- 20+ Success Criteria: Measurable outcomes and deployment quality metrics
- 6 Major Risks identified with mitigation strategies: Insufficient Resources, Docker Build Failures, Minikube Networking, AI DevOps Tool Unavailability, Configuration Complexity, Database Connection Issues

Specification is technology-agnostic and focuses on WHAT and WHY rather than HOW. Branch created: 004-local-k8s-deployment

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete specification created for Phase IV Local Kubernetes Deployment with all mandatory sections completed
- 🧪 Tests: Specification quality validation passed - all items marked complete
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md (404 lines), requirements.md checklist, switched to new branch 004-local-k8s-deployment
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed to /sp.plan for architecture design and task breakdown
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification covers all requirements from hackathon document. No clarifications needed as requirements were well-defined. Ready for planning phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification was clear and complete
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all checklist items complete
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to architecture planning phase
