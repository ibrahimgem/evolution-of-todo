"""MCP Tools for Todo Management

This package contains Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools that enable the AI agent
to interact with the todo database. Each tool represents a specific operation
(add_task, list_tasks, complete_task, delete_task, update_task).

Tools will be registered with the MCP server in mcp_server.py and invoked by the
OpenAI agent in agent.py.
